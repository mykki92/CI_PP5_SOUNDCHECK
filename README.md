## About
Soundcheck is a music-based social media platform where artists and fans can share content and information on new music and upcoming shows, find new artists and friends and network with like-minded people. 
Everyone can like other users' pictures and share their opinion on every post. Users can also follow their favourite profiles and easily see updates on their activity, and save a list of posts that they like to view again later.
