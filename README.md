## About
Soundcheck is a music-based social media platform where artists and fans can share content and information on new music and upcoming shows, find new artists and friends and network with like-minded people. 
Everyone can like other users' pictures and share their opinion on every post. Users can also follow their favourite profiles and easily see updates on their activity, and save a list of posts that they like to view again later.


## Project Goals
The goal for this project was to build a platform to enable users to interact with others in various ways such as posting content, liking and commenting on posts or following their profile.
The platform is intended to be informal and based on media and entertainment.

The key functionality aspects:
- simple and intuitive navigation across all pages
- user authentication
- user interaction via posts, comments, likes, followers
- user profiles with profile pictures, bios and profile stats
- CRUD functionality for posts, comments, likes, followers and profile information
- posts filtering by caption and author
- responsiveness for consistent user experience across all devices
